Thank you for supporting Wonderville!

Each folder contains a different Processing example from this class. You can check out the code for individual exmaples, or download the entire repository as a zip file by clicking the green "clone or download" button on the top left.

player.png is used in the stretch and bounce example. I copied it into the root of this repo to make it easier to find.
